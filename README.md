# Introduction
My graduate advisor worked in the past with a prominent U.S. entity (which shall remain nameless - all work contained in this repo is my own and has been cleared to display publicly as long as the source of the data remains anonymous) which was interested in monitoring the cognitive context of its employees through non-invasive means in order to better delegate tasks and reduce human error during human/machine interaction. Previous studies have related pupil diameter to the level of focus which an individual is currently experiencing.<br/><br/>
This repository contains a program which employs a Neural Network (NN) designed to recieve input data in the form of an individual's pupil diameter in order to detect whether or not the particular individual is currently engaged in a task which they consider to be easy, somewhat difficult, or very difficult. A short training/calibration period is necessary (approximately 20 minutes - the duration can be adjusted depending on necessity), during which time the NN learns the specific parameters of that individual. After the training period the program is designed to take measurements every 2 minutes using data from that time frame to construct a single feature vector, outputting the level of focus that the individual was most likely experiencing during that two minutes.
